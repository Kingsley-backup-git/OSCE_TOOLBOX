            First, I used it just by myself; I would read the patients description, then move onto to ask all relevant questions and mark what I did well and what I could improve on. Then I used the toolbox with my peers, where one of us pretended to be the patient and one the pharmacist, which was quite useful.

           I would recommend it as the subscription price is very reasonable with few subscription options, you can cancel it any time, and you have a lot of scenarios to practice on. It is great for solo practice as well as the group practice.

          I loved the analytical checklist. This had allowed me to see where the marks were available and the main bits that i was missing throughout the OSCE.

         The question a day was the best feature. It was exactly like one of the final exams I had in final year. I would answer the question everyday and take a photo of it. At the end of each month I would go through all the questions I had collected and redid them, any that I got wrong I read the reasoning for the correct answer and highlighted that topic as an area for me to focus revision on.

         It directed me towards the more effective preparation for osce as I had access to a lot of scenarios rather than about 5 from university and that&apos;s it. I was very motivated to prepare myself for the most challenging scenarios.

         The most useful features are the checklist on the mark scheme with the red flag sections in particular. The checklist ensures I cover all key points, while the red flag explanations help me understand why it&apos;s so necessary to mention these to the patient.
